# NewbChain-Java-Project

This project's goal is to implement a Java Blockchain for learning purposes. The following fundumentals of Blockchain will be taken into account:

* Creation of blocks that store data.
* Generation of a digital signature that chains blocks together.
* Validation of new blocks by providing a proof of work.
* Verification that Blocks are valid and data is unchanged.

## How can I compile & execute the project?

```
mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.cryptocurrency.newbcoin.Main"
```

## Wanna contribute to this project?

Here are some ideas that could be great additions to this project:

* Creation of a Mock server simulating a certain number of nodes.
* Handling communication between nodes (HTTP Websockets for example).
* ... and more ;)

Have fun!
