# NewbChain-Java-Project

This project's goal is to implement a Java Blockchain for learning purposes. The following fundumentals of Blockchain will be taken into account:

* Creation of blocks that store data.
* Generation of a digital signature that chains blocks together.
* Validation of new blocks by providing a proof of work.
* Verification that Blocks are valid and data is unchanged.

## How can I compile the project locally?

```
mvn clean install
```

## How can I execute the project?

```
java -jar target/newbchain-1.0.0.jar
```

## Wanna contribute to this project?

Here are some ideas that could be great additions to this project:

* Creation of a Mock server simulating a certain number of nodes.
* Handling communication between nodes (HTTP Websockets for example).
* Wallets management (private & pulic key etc).
* ... and more ;)

Have fun!
